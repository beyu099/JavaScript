    <p> What should the above code console.log?
        <strong>
            Keep it up!
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p> Why do we not need to specify if(isLearning === true)? Why does if(isLearning) work on its own?
        <strong>
            What I understand is that, this occur because true is a truthy value and Javascript will look for truthy statement. It's still not very clear why it does that.
        </strong>

        let firstvariable;
        <br>
        let secondvariable = "";
        <br>
        let thirdvariable = 1;
        <br>
        let secretMessage = "Shh!";
        <br>

        if(firstvariable){
            <br>
    console.log("first");
    <br>
        } else if(firstvariable || secondvariable){
            <br>
    console.log("second");
    <br>
        } else if(firstvariable || thirdvariable){
            <br>
    console.log("third");
    <br>
        } else {
            <br>
    console.log("fourth");
        }
    </p>
    <p> What should the above code console.log? Why?
        <strong>
            The code will console "third" because the third statement is truthy.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p> What is the value of firstvariable when it is initialized?
        <strong>
            It is undefined because nothing was assigned to it.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p> Is the value of firstvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
        <strong>
            No, It is falsy. The value of firstvariable is falsy because nothing was assignned to it.
        </strong>
    </p> 
    <p> Is the value of secondvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
        <strong>
            No. Javascript treats empty strings as falsy.
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p> Is the value of thirdvariable a "truthy" value? Why?
        <strong>
           Yes, because Javascript treats numbers (except 0) as truthy. 
        </strong>
